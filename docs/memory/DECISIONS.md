# Creature Forge — durable decisions

This is the Git-visible decision index. Add one dated section per consequential choice, with status (`active`, `superseded`, or `proposed`), alternatives, reason and concrete evidence. Prefer succinct entries linking to ADRs/commits instead of copying large discussions.

## 2026-10-13 — Memory architecture

- **Status:** active as repository policy; external MCP not yet connected.
- **Decision:** use `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` + verified `PROJECT_STATE.md` for every agent; Git-tracked decisions/incidents for fallback; Basic Memory MCP as an optional semantic/linked cross-tool store.
- **Why:** memory notes must never override filesystem or tests; remote connection cannot be assumed.
- **Evidence:** `docs/MEMORY_SYSTEM.md`, `scripts/context_preflight.py`, `.claude/settings.json`.
- **Revisit if:** cross-tool authentication, retrieval quality or maintenance overhead fails evaluation.

## 2026-10-13 — Physics and AI separation

- **Status:** design decision, not implemented.
- **Decision:** MuJoCo is authoritative for physics; NVIDIA Nemotron through Nebius proposes falsifiable hypotheses and experiments; deterministic verifier adjudicates outcomes.
- **Evidence:** `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md` sections 4–5 and 9–11.
- **Revisit if:** new backend exhibits better validated physical accuracy and comparable reproducibility.
